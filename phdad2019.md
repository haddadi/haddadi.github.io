\* Funding: The post is supported by full fees and stipend (at the UK/EU student rate).

\* Research environment: You will Join the Systems and Algorithms Laboratory ([SysAl](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/sysal)), in the newly refurbished facilities of the Dyson School of Design Engineering ([http://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/)). You will also be part of the [Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/cyber-security/) have extensive interactions with research collaborators from industry labs and research institutions across the world.

\* Required skills: We are seeking candidates with a**First Class (Distinction)****Degree or equivalent at Masters&#39; level in **Computer Science, Electronics Engineering, Mathematics, or a related subject**. ** ** Our minimum entrance requirement is a good Upper Second Degree at Masters&#39; level. Strong quantitative research skills and familiarity with advanced systems programming (mobile, TEEs, virtualisation) and advanced data analysis skills are essential.**A passion for user-centred systems and Human-Data Interaction (fairness, transparency, privacy, legibility) with ML models, demonstrated by extra-curricular activities or industrial experience, is desirable. Good team-working and communication skills are essential.

Informal inquiries should be sent to Dr. Hamed Haddadi: [h.haddadi@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:h.haddadi@imperial.ac.uk) along with a CV.
