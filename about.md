I studied for my PhD between Oct 2004-Oct 2008, investigating the [Topological Characteristics of IP Networks](https://haddadi.github.io/papers/thesis.pdf), which I successfully defended on 31st October 2008. My examiners were [George Pavlou](http://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/%7Egpavlou/) and [Christos Gkantsidis](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/chrisgk/). I carried out my thesis research jointly between two great labs, the [NetOS Group](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/), Computer Laboratory, Cambridge University (userid: hh318), and Networks and Services Research Laboratory Group, UCL (supervised by: [Miguel Rio](http://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/%7Emrio/), [Andrew Moore](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Eawm22/) , [Richard Mortier](http://mort.io))  

I was also a scholar at [London Business School](http://www.london.edu/), under the UCL CSEL sponsorship programme, attending MBA electives.  

My MPhil (transfer) Thesis investigated Network Traffic Inference Using Sampled Statistics [[pdf](https://haddadi.github.io/papers/mphil.pdf)].  
In 2004 I completed the MSc in Telecommunication Engineering with distinction. I was sponsored by EPSRC, Project: kOS “kind of Operating System” ([report](https://haddadi.github.io/papers/MScThesis.pdf)). This work had contributions to technology spin-out [Senceive](http://www.senceive.com/).
