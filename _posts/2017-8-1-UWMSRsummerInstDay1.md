IoT as in interdisciplinary topic, hence a range of skills and expertise involved in this summer institute. Important to get interaction across disciplines. The industry is on a race to deployment, and academia is working on visionary projects. It is important to get conversation going between the two. 

There are infrastructure questions: AI, Intelligent Edge, IoT, etc. While academia has been discussing this for a while, a push from huge industry partners will drive this forward, while privacy & security are of importance here. This Institute aims to drive collaborations, joint projects and publications, while highlighting the risks and challenges.
