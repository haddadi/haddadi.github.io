Our work "GuaranTEE: Towards Attestable and Private ML with CCA" will appear at [EuroMLSys](https://euromlsys.eu/) 2024! ðŸŽ‰ 

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00190) 
[Code](https://github.com/comet-cc/GuaranTEE)

This is joint work with Sina Abdollahi, Mohammad Maheri, Marios Kogias, and Sandra Siby.

We explore how Arm's Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA) can be used to deploy private and attestable ML models on end devices. We develop a prototype on Arm's Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) simulator.

As CCA is still under development, to facilitate further research in this space, we're releasing code and a setup guide. Check out our GitHub link above!

Chat with us at EuroMLSys later this month, and stay tuned for (longer) follow-up work in this direction!
